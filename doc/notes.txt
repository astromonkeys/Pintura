Little design notes file, just for me to remember

//

bigger TODOs:
- add p5.js sketch! make it look good
    - this will prob take a while and almost be a separate project by itself
- add basic weather widget
- implement more advanced spotify music playing functionality(searching, browsing the user's library, etc.)
- add fun stuff like animations n shadows n shit, definitely play around with the classes bootstrap offers in your html elements
- figure out refresh tokens/when to ask for them, not urgent
- more robust playlist searching, ability to search for songs too

// misc TODOs:
- fix not removing our device(s) when the window closes *** high(ish) priority if my current solution doesn't end up working after a delay
- some of my api calls may be unnecessary(ie getting entire track when I just need album artwork, etc.)
- implement scrubbing with the song progress bar
- make icons more sophisticated/colorful -> maybe use different svg library
- maybe save the state of the UI so on a refresh we can use that and it doesn't go to a blank slate
- play button icon is still wonky, maybe fix eventually cause it's weird but mostly works, has the same problem as the shuffle/repeat buttons of multiple places changing the icon

// KNOWN BUGS:
- playlist selection sometimes yields an undefined and fails


- Using bootstrap instead of a framework like react since things need to be lightweight, as the background graphics will be a bit performance hungry
    - plus, since there's only one page and minimal content that needs minimally sophisticated life cycle management
    - Maaaaaaaybe switch to react since component capability makes sense here
        - update: will not be doing this

- (not so) New auth flow:
    - call auth functions to get token and trigger page refresh
    - in the background, the playback sdk will set a boolean to true when it's ready
    - after auth flow has completed, wait until that boolean is true, then initialize web player with the token we got
        - this should typically be already ready to go once the auth flow is done, or a very short delay thereafter so it's probably(..?) fine

- p5.js has a print function defined! nice

- the red I'm using is #dc3545, border color is #af2e3a => maybe change?

- customize google search bar: https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/lookandfeel?cx=6372d402929ca4da2
