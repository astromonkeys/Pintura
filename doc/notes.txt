Little design notes file, just for me to remember

//

TODOs:
- design the spotify player widget & code it(barebones)
- add basic weather widget
- implement more advanced spotify music playing functionality(switching/browsing playlists, etc.), once player is made
- make google search bar look nicer (https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/lookandfeel?cx=6372d402929ca4da2)
- use (s)css to get the layout of the page how I want it
- add fun stuff like animations n shadows n shit, definitely play around with the classes bootstrap offers in your html elements
- figure out refresh tokens/when to ask for them, not urgent
- more robust playlist searching, ability to search for songs too

// KNOWN BUGS:
- playlist selection sometimes yields an undefined and fails

- Using bootstrap instead of a framework like react since things need to be lightweight, as the background graphics will be a bit performance hungry
    - plus, since there's only one page and minimal content that doesn't need sophisticated life cycle management
    - Maaaaaaaybe switch to react since component capability makes sense here

- New auth flow:
    - call auth functions to get token and trigger page refresh
    - in the background, the playback sdk will set a boolean to true when it's ready
    - after auth flow has completed, wait until that boolean is true, then initialize web player with the token we got
        - this should typically be already ready to go once the auth flow is done, or a very short delay thereafter so it's probably(..?) fine

- p5.js has a print function defined! nice
