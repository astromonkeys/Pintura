Little design notes file, just for me to remember

//

TODOs:
1. figure out refresh tokens/when to ask for them, not urgent
2. add a google search bar widget, next task
3. design the spotify player widget & code it
4. implement more advanced spotify music playing functionality, once 3 is done

- Using bootstrap instead of a framework like react since things need to be lightweight, as the background graphics will be a bit performance hungry
    - plus, since there's only one page and minimal content that doesn't need sophisticated life cycle management

- New auth flow:
    - call auth functions to get token and trigger page refresh
    - in the background, the playback sdk will set a boolean to true when it's ready
    - after auth flow has completed, wait until that boolean is true, then initialize web player with the token we got
        - this should typically be already ready to go once the auth flow is done, or a very short delay thereafter so it's probably(..?) fine

- p5.js has a print function defined! nice
